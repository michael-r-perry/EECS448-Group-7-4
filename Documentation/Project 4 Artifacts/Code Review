Our team did a code review of the market news section of main.js. In particular the updateMarketNews function. Currently our market news section of the site
is functional, but it could be further optimized. A large crutch of our project is the API call limits. Because we are utilizing finnhub's API and we opted 
to use the free version, we have a limited number of API calls per minute. This means that as a project in total we are not only limited in our abilites
but also are incentivized to optimize our site as much as possible to only call the API when absolutely needed.

As of now our market news section's function is the pulls the top 5 news stories from the finnhub market news endpoint. When calling the API with the market news endpoint
the JSON we recieve contains an array of up to 100 "news" objects. Within each object there are these properties:
category, datetime, headline, id, image, related, source, summary, url
Our APIgetMarketNews function is the function that takes in an index, calls the API and then assigns the values accordingly. This is the function that is called
inside of the updateMarketNews function in main. Because we have a fixed number of stories to be dislayed on the page (5), inside of updateMarketNews we call
APIgetMarketNews 5 times. In the essence of further optimizing our site and minimizing the number of API calls we have decided to review this function. There 
should be a way for us to get the same ammount of data with only a single API call. This is the only defect that was found while reviewing the updateMarketNews
function. Reducing the number of API calls from 5 to 1 is the goal of this code review.

The way to do this would be similar to how we achieved this in the gainers and losers section. Although the gainers and losers uses a different API, ultimatley 
the method is the same. Instead of our APIgetMarketNews function taking in an index and then getting the data for that piece of news, we will remove the index
and just pull all of the data at once. This also will require some changes to the news object and its setMarketNews function to make things work.

After discussing the method to optimize the previously mentioned functions, Curtis has decided to be the one applying the fix. Curtis volunteered because he is the one
who originally worked on the market and company news sections. He also applied a similar fix to the gainers and losers API calls that reduced the number of API calls
as well. He is farmiliar with the methods and the plan to remedy this problem in an efficient manner.

Curtis accomplished the fix by removing the news array and replacing it with a newly adapted single news object. The news object now has room for all the data for
5 pieces of news instead of one. When the API is called the newly expanded news object will get and store the date for all 5 pieces of news. When changing the html
to reflect the news data, each element will be referencing the expanded single news object instead of an index in an array of news objects.
Now the API will only need to be called once.
